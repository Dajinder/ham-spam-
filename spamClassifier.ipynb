I started coding with C, then C++, and\\n\\n&gt;moved on to Java... And, I think that:\\n\\nRobert Harley wrote:\\n\\n&gt;Looks like a case of \"MY experience is comprehensive, YOUR'S is\\n\\n&gt;anecdotal, THEY don't know what they're talking about\".\\n\\n\\n\\nWell, I sure don't claim that... I think most people on Fork probably have\\n\\nmore programming knowledge than I do... There's lots of experience out\\n\\nhere...\\n\\n\\n\\nReza B'Far wrote:\\n\\n&gt;1.  The people who pay the wages don't give a flyin' heck what programming\\n\\n&gt;language you write things in... they just want it to work.\\n\\nRobert Harley wrote:\\n\\n&gt;In my experience, they do care.  It has to work certainly, and in\\n\\n&gt;particular it has to work with what they've already got, and it has to\\n\\n&gt;work on client's systems.\\n\\n&gt;My limited experience of Java started a few years ago when support on\\n\\n&gt;Linux was so terrible that I ran away screaming and haven't come back yet.\\n\\n\\n\\nWell, I think until recently, support for most things on Linux was kind of\\n\\nshady... Things have got much better... You're right in that the JDK used to\\n\\nsuck on Linux... But then, IMHO, Linux is still maturing.... or at least\\n\\ndevelopment tools for Linux are maturing... I've been developing a few\\n\\nserver side apps that run on Linux recently with JDK 1.3.x and they've had\\n\\nno problems with great performance.\\n\\n\\n\\nRobert Harley worte:\\n\\n&gt;Microsoft has announced that they plan to remove Java from Windows.\\n\\n&gt;They took it out of XP already and it has to be installed with a\\n\\n&gt;service pack.  Somehow, I can't imagine them removing the ability to\\n\\n&gt;run C programs.\\n\\n\\n\\nHmmm... Do you really think that MS is pulling out Java because it's a \"Bad\"\\n\\nprogramming language or application platform?  You don't think this has\\n\\nanything to do with .NET being a competitor to Java do you?  Or that MS has\\n\\nbasically copied Java (with some additional features) and called it C#?\\n\\nIsn't that alone an indication that they actually DO think that a VM is the\\n\\nright way to go for most high level applications?\\n\\n\\n\\nReza B'Far wrote:\\n\\n&gt;2.  C and C++ forces the developer to solve problems such as memory\\n\\n&gt;management over and over again.\\n\\nRobert Harley wrote:\\n\\n&gt;Can't say I spend any noticeable amount of time on memory management\\n\\n&gt;issues, apart from the fact that I frequently need &gt; 4 GB.\\n\\n\\n\\nHmmm again.... You're telling me that you've never had a nasty bug that took\\n\\nyou a couple of days to track down that had to do with a memory leak?  I am\\n\\nnot the best C/C++ programmer... not even close... But I've known really\\n\\ngood ones... and even they have nasty bugs that have to do with memory\\n\\nmanagement, however occasional they may be.\\n\\n\\n\\n&gt;It's about design patterns, architecture, high level stuff...\\n\\nRobert Harley wrote:\\n\\n&gt;If your problem just requires application of a \"design pattern\" to solve,\\n\\n&gt;then it's trivial anyway irrespective of language.\\n\\n\\n\\nWow!  So you're telling me that unless the application involves\\n\\nbit-counting, it's trivial?  What about the application itself?  What about\\n\\nhigh level problems such as task distribution, work-flow, etc.?  Aren't most\\n\\nhigh level problems solved with high level solutions like design patterns?\\n\\nOr do you solve high level problems by writing optimal C/C++ code?  For\\n\\nexample, do you think that most people working on collaboration frameworks\\n\\n(there are lots of them on this list), are working on writing an operating\\n\\nsystem with assembly that provides for a collaborative environment?\\n\\n\\n\\n&gt;I am amazed by the amount of time wasted by people talking about low\\n\\n&gt;level problems that have been solved 10 million times over and over\\n\\n&gt;and over again...\\n\\nRobert Harley wrote:\\n\\n&gt;You appear to be gratuitously asserting that C programmers waste time\\n\\n&gt;on irrelevant low-level problems and Java programmers don't.  Depends\\n\\n&gt;entirely on the programmer, not the language.\\n\\n\\n\\nI can see how you could infer this. However, what I believe to really be the\\n\\ncase is that Java is one of the best languages for writing large\\n\\napplications with many components that involves the collaboration of more\\n\\nthan three programmers.  In those cases, it's always very hard to get the\\n\\nprogrammers to agree on API's, memory management techniques, etc.  With\\n\\nJava, the JCP takes care of the discussions so that you don't sit around in\\n\\na long meeting trying to decide what API to use to hook up to a database\\n\\n(JDBC) or a messaging bus (JMS).\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n&gt;3.  Java is not just a programming language! It's also a platform...\\n\\nRobert Harley wrote:\\n\\n&gt;Buzzword.\\n\\n\\n\\nYIKES!  Have you written db code with C/C++ for different databases (just an\\n\\nexample)?  Tried porting a persistence layer from Windows to Unix?  Say you\\n\\nhave Informix running on Solaris and you want to port to Windows with MS SQL\\n\\n(bad idea...but for the sake of the example), would you rather deal with\\n\\nJDBC port or C/C++ port that uses Informix drivers and now you have to use\\n\\nODBC?\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n&gt;a monolithic set of API's or a crap load of different API's slicing\\n\\n&gt;and dicing the same problems 50 different ways?\\n\\nRobert Harley wrote:\\n\\n&gt;Unsupported assertion.\\n\\n\\n\\nSo, are you saying that there is a standard set of API's for C/C++ for\\n\\neverything? (aside to the minimal ANSI stuff).  Is there a standard way of\\n\\ndealing with C/C++ applications for various domain problems (messaging,\\n\\ndatabase persistence, etc.) that rivals Java?  I'd like to know if there is\\n\\none accepted by everyone who writes C/C++... In that case, I claim\\n\\nignorance...\\n\\n\\n\\nNot suggesting that Java is the golden hammer.... Just that C/C++ is\\n\\noverkill for most things... I even coded in VB... But VB is a true disgrace\\n\\nto programming... It's just lame... Java is Object Oriented... (no\\n\\nflame-mail from the anti-OO people please... that is a religious\\n\\ndiscussion...) and relatively clean... And I don't think that every \"Kid\"\\n\\ncan write a well designed Java program.  Kids typically don't understand\\n\\nvarious design patterns and principles... To my experience, they actually\\n\\ntend to think more of the low level problems, wanting to rewrite and\\n\\nreinvent the world... a tendency that is much more possible, IMHO, in C/C++\\n\\nthan in Java due to existence of standard API's.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n</th>\n",

It did not.\\n\\n\\n\\nPg 92:\\n\\nThe value of land in the formal sector of Lima averages US$50 per square\\n\\nmeter, whereas in the area of Gamarra, where a great deal of Peru's\\n\\ninformal manufacturing sector resides, the value per square meter can go\\n\\nas high as US$3,000.\\n\\n\\n\\n==========\\n\\n\\n\\nI'd have made the same assumption you did.  De Soto says that isn't\\n\\ncorrect.  You can find mansions that don't have title.  A lot of them,\\n\\nin fact.  But they can't be used for collateral for a loan, or otherwise\\n\\nparticipate as 'capital' because of their extra-legal status.\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n&gt; &gt; Mr. Long, I think you'd particularly enjoy the De Soto work.\\n\\n&gt; \\n\\n&gt; On the \"to find\" list.  Any chance of\\n\\n&gt; an explanation of that \"Bell Jar\" in\\n\\n&gt; the meantime?\\n\\n\\n\\nFrench historian Fernand Braudel (so Braudel's Bell Jar, not De Soto's)\\n\\n\\n\\n==&gt;\\n\\n\\n\\nThe key problem is to find out why that sector of society of the past,\\n\\nwhich I would not hesitate to call capitalist, should have lived as if\\n\\nin a bell jar, cut off from the rest; why was it not able to expand and\\n\\nconquer the whole of society? ... [Why was it that] a significant rate\\n\\nof capital formation was possible only in certain sectors and not in the\\n\\nwhole market economy of the time? ... It would perhaps be teasingly\\n\\nparadoxial to say that whatever was in short supply, money certainly was\\n\\nnot ... so this was an age where poor land was bought up and magnificent\\n\\ncountry residents built ... [How do we] resolve the contradiction ...\\n\\nbetween the depressed economic climate and the splendors of Florence\\n\\nunder Lorenzo the Magnificent?\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n--------------\\n\\n\\n\\nDe Soto's theory is that the Bell Jar is formed when you segregate those\\n\\nwho have *practical* access to legal property rights and those who do\\n\\nnot.  The poor[1] have property -- lots and lots of property.  What they\\n\\ndon't have is access to the systems where we turn property into capital\\n\\nand allow it to start growing.  Their property can only be exchanged\\n\\nwith a small section of people who know them personally.\\n\\n\\n\\n[1] Actual poor people, not 'poor' Americans with a living standard that\\n\\nis the envy of most of the world.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nhttp://xent.com/mailman/listinfo/fork\\n\\n\\n</th>\n",

The VNC connection is tunneled over ssh and is\\n\\ncarried over the Internet via an IPSEC appliance.\\n\\n\\n\\nThat gives me access to both home and work email from either \\n\\nplace without the complications involved in having two copies of \\n\\nexmh working on the same set of folders.\\n\\n\\n\\nIt's a tad slow viewing work email when I'm at work ... but not \\n\\nso bad that I can't stand it.\\n\\n\\n\\n--Hal\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n_______________________________________________\\n\\nExmh-users mailing list\\n\\nExmh-users@redhat.com\\n\\nhttps://listman.redhat.com/mailman/listinfo/exmh-users\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n</th>\n",

This is the product and the VALUE that you have been searching for. This is the product that you will buy again &amp; again!\\n\\n\\n\\nWe have been in the business (science) of developing non-cannabis, personal choice sensitive smoking agendas for a good, goodly while. Along this avenue of ethnobotany, we have always strived to achieve greater and greater \"Sensitivity / Responsiveness\" &amp; Aphrodisia within our gourmet smokables and brews. And indeed, we have. Many of these previous products are still marketed today by companies who are less developmental than our botanical resource cooperative. Even our own two signature \"smokables\" (Ragga Dagga &amp; Stoney Mahoney) are being discontinued. That Shangrila Zowie Wowie is by far such a superior product is undeniable, therefore it makes no sense to us at all to offer any other smoking product. Quite simply we have surpassed even our own expectations of excellence, thereby; our definition of excellence has evolved. This \"Shangrila\" project has been in research and development for sometime on two fronts. First, on an agricultural level, fields for our Gnarly SweetGrass!\\n\\n must be planted and be allowed to propagate for several years before initial harvest can even be undertaken. This is how the botanical achieves \"potent significance\" much like the regimen of ginseng. Also, harvest time is limited and can take place only twice a year, as like the hemp plant, maximum potency is only achieved after \"flowering\" occurs. But, unlike the hemp plant, and for that matter, unlike most herbs, the entire base plant of Shangrila Zowie Wowie (leave, stem &amp; root) is all \"viripotent,\" which makes this \"gnarly stoke\" a botanical phenomenon! As well, most potentiating factors of Shangrila, as well as the primary botanical factor of Shangrila, will not achieve \"viripotency\" if grown in our hemisphere, therefore; Shangrila is indeed a multi-national, multi-complicated, agricultural undertaking. However, all of this undertaking has indeed been worthwhile! Secondly, the potentiating, infusion regimen used to enhance the attributes of Shangrila has also taken a lon!\\n\\ng time to bring into potent fruition as there are many balancings of the various molecular factors involved in the completion of Zowie Wowie. We are most pleased to be able to say, as you will note in the experience of Shangrila Zowie Wowie, that this process has achieved fruition.\\n\\n\\n\\nSuffice to say, without any hype or glype, Shangrila Zowie Wowie Gnarly SweetGrass is without a doubt, the most significant, non-invasive, non-cannabis, \"sensitive/responsive\", personal choice, absolutely legal (cannot fail a drug test), smoking (\"Smoka\") botanical on our planet ... probably in the universe! Hard to believe that this product is ABSOLUTELY LEGAL!\\n\\n\\n\\n* Mill-stoned &amp; honed.\\n\\n* Depressive regressive!\\n\\n* Psychologically uplifting!\\n\\n* Good-bye stress, anxiety &amp; restlessness!\\n\\n* Sophisticated, well-balanced \"ambiance.\"\\n\\n* Inspires contemplativeness and creativity.\\n\\n* \"Potentiated\" &amp; viripotent!\\n\\n* 4  5 draws lasts a good, goodly while.\\n\\n* Sweet aphrodisia!

As is an herbalist's way, four or five draws of \"Smoka\" should be inhaled and retained. For the non-smoker, it is most appropriate to engage this herbaceousness as a potentiated tea/brew. (Steep approximately one teaspoon of Shangrila Zowie Wowie (tm) herba per one cup of water for ten minutes or so &amp; strain.) When smoking Shangrila Zowie Wowie (tm), please draw gently as it is a most preeminent \"Sensitive / Responsive\" Smoke. Both a personal water-pipe (huuka) (water-pipe is included with quarter pound can only) and a standard herb-pipe are included for your smoking convenience and delight. Smoke and Brew concurrently is absolutely a Sweet, Sensitive Treat!\\n\\n\\n\\nShangrila Zowie Wowie (tm) \"Sensitive/Responsive\" Smoka includes and is potentiated with the following non-irradiated, Mill-Stoned &amp; Honed, exotica botanicals and botanical essences: Half-edged Lily-rare Bian Lian (lobeline factors), Kona Lactuca virosa, Yucatan Turnera aphrodisaca, Hawaiian Vervain (Maui strain), Siberian Leonorus Sibricus, rare Lotus Leaf, Jamaican Blue Verbena officinalis, Spanish Peumus Crocus Sativa, Chinese (flowering-tops only) Horny Goat Weed, Ginko Biloba, African Cola Vera, and African Wilde Dagga (flowering-tops only). Shangrila Zowie Wowie (tm) does not include any tobacco or any cannabis factors.

Prosaka botanical tablets were originally introduced as a botanical, supplemental alternative to various traditional medications that are prescribed for stress, anxiety, depressiveness, mood enhancement, insomnia, excessive dream activity, etc. We like to use this analogy: Imagine the circumstances of your life to be hurricane-ish. Certainly, Prosaka will not stop the wind from blowing. However, it will help to center you within the calm eye of your hurricane, so that you will better see your living and make your decisions from a calmer, more serene, more balanced perspective. Please note that when undertaking any supplemental herbal regimen in this arena, it is important to make a personal commitment to the therapy. It would make no sense to purchase Prosaka and to take it only sporadic!\\n\\nally or only briefly. It is for this reason, although Prosaka is a very expensive formulation to produce; that we offer 300 count containers at as much of a reduced price as we are able to offer.\\n\\n\\n\\nProsaka is an exclusive, proprietary amalgamation in tablet form which includes the following uncommon botanicals, extracts, flower-top essences and essential oils: Radix Salviae, Sensitive Mimosa Bark, Arillus Euphoriae, Shizandra, Frutcus Mori, Caulis Polygoni, Zizyohus, Tang Kuei, Cedar Seed, Sweetflag Rhizome, Cuscutae, Amber, Radix Scutellariae, Evodia, Longan, Arisaema, Cistanches, Radix Polygalae, Red Sage Root and Eucommia. No factor contained within Prosaka is restricted or regulated by law. All botanicals contained within are non-irradiated and are of pharmaceutical grade. \\n\\n\\n\\nSuggested Usage: 1 - 2 tablets; 2 to 3 times per day as needed. Best taken on an empty stomach. (During times of intensity up to 10 tablets per day may be utilized.) \\n\\n\\n\\nAlso Note: Prosaka is not intended to supercede physician's care nor is it intended for use during pregnancy.\\n\\n\\n\\n********************************************************\\n\\nPROSAKA PRICING:\\n\\n\\n\\n* One 100 count bag ... $55.00 plus shipping\\n\\n* One 300 count container ... $130.00 plus shipping\\n\\nFor larger quantities, please inquire.\\n\\n\\n\\n(See Intro Offers at bottom of this text for further savings!)\\n\\n\\n\\n*******************************************\\n\\n**AQUEOUS KATHMANDU (tm) (Happy Drops)**\\n\\n*******************************************\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Personal Choice\" enhanced \"Sensitivity\" for non-smokers &amp; tokers.\\n\\n\\n\\nAqueous Kathmandu has only been offered to market at large for a short while.
